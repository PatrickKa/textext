Version 0.6 (31.01.2017)
========================
Fixed:
"too many values to unpack"-error in Inkscape 0.92

Fixed:
TexText does not work with 64-bit versions of Inkscape under MS Windows

Improved:
TexText does not care anymore if 32-bit or 64-bit versions of pstoedit, 
ImageMagick and ghostscript are installed

Version 0.5.2
=============
Fixed: 
If working with Inkscape files stored with older versions of Inkscape or TexText
it could happen that - after editing of a LaTeX node - the rendered object becomes
invisible (in fact: transparent) because the fill attribute was not properly set.

Fixed:
Installation under MS Windows as non admin user ends up with the plugin installed
into the wrong directory.

Fixed:
Column numbers do not change during editing of the LaTeX-code under Linux and TK.
The Column-number is nor removed from the dialog if the TK interface is used.

Fixed:
setup.py for the Linux installation does not run under Python 3.

Improved:
More detailled error information is passed to the user during setup of the
Linux package.

Updated:
The readme-files have been updated to the new version number. Furthermore, links
for download of the additional software have been added as well as a comment
that the plugin will only work usign 32bit versions of Inkscape. Furthermore,
there is only one readme now for both, Linux and Windows.



Version 0.5.1
=============
Fixed:
TexText does not work with Inkscape 0.9.1

It is ensured now that Inkscape works under both, Inkscape 0.48 and Inkscape 0.91.
